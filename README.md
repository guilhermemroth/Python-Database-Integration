<h2>SQLAlchemy and PyMongo</h2>

<h3>Pt1:</h3>
Integrating Python and Relational Database Management System using SQLAlchemy

<h3>Pt2:</h3>
Integrating Python with MongoDB Using Pymongo

<h3>Challenge</h3>
<h4>Part 1 - Implementing a Relational Database with SQLAlchemy</h4>
<h5>Goal:</h5>
In this challenge you will implement an integration application with SQLite based on an available relational schema. Therefore, use the schema within the client and account context to create your API classes. These classes will represent the relational database tables within the application.

<h5>Deliverable:</h5>
Application with schema definition through classes using SQLAlchemy
Insertion of a minimum data set for information manipulation
Execution of data recovery methods via SQLAlchemy
 

<h4>Part 2 â€“ Implementing a NoSQL Database with Pymongo</h4>
<h5>Goal:</h5>
You will implement a NoSQL database with mongodb to provide an aggregated view of the relational model. As such, existing customer and account information is contained within customer-specific documents.

<h5>Perform the operations:</h5>
Connect to mongo atlas and create a database
Define a bank collection to create customer documents
Insert documents with the mentioned structure
Write information retrieval instructions based on key-value pairs as done in class
